# Comatose

* Version: 3.0.0 (beta)
* Author:  Bryan Taylor (originally written by Matt McCray)
* Website: github.com/rubyisbeautiful/comatose
* Email: artofobjects at gmail dot com


*Comatose* is a micro CMS designed for being embedded into existing Rails 
applications.

It's intended for simple CMS support. Comatose supports 

 * Nested pages
 * Versioning
 * Page markup in Textile, Markdown, RDoc, or easily add your own 
 * Page processing through Liquid or ERb
 * Generators for easy installation/migration
 * Self-contained gem containing a Rails::Engine
 * Code Editor for mark, designed by scienco.de (http://blog.scienceco.de/2011/06/19/einfacher-javascript-code-editor/)

It's meant to be lean, mean, easily embedded, and easy to re-skin for 
existing applications. If you need something more, I would recommend 
looking into Radiant, Mephisto, Refinery, BrowserCMS, or Locomotive.

For more information, see the [Getting Started][] guide.

### Requirements

 * Rails 3.0.x (3.0.9)
 * `acts_as_list-rails3`, `acts_as_tree_rails3`, and `liquid` gems are required (at the moment)


### Development Notes

*NOTE*: This is a port of Comatose, which was last maintained in 2008.  This
        branch of Comatose is built specifically for Rails 3.
        There is no legacy support.

 * Make comatose fully self-contained, which means removing `acts_as_(tree|list)`
 * Improve `ComatoseAdminController` to reduce number of DB calls for building the page tree
 * `Comatose.configure` needs to be an initializer (update docs)
 * Give access to all the default rails helpers to Comatose Pages by default?
 * UI refresh (nothing major, just some cleanup).
 * RESTful goodness.
 * Support XML/JSON responses from `ComatoseController` and `ComatoseAdminController`.
 * Support for static rendering (for generating sites like this blog).

### Installation

*Note*: See the 'Upgrading' section if you already have an older version of 
        the comatose plugin installed.

    $ gem install comatose
    $ rails generate comatose
    $ rake db:migrate
    $ rails server

Open your `routes.rb` and add the following:

    routes_for_comatose

That's it, you're ready to go! You should be able to browse to 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/en/comatose and start adding pages to your CMS.
Browsing to http://127.0.0.1:3000/en will render your comatose pages if
routing doesn't match any of your controllers. 


### Configuration

You configure Comatose in your `config/intializers/comatose.rb` file. Here is an example
configuration block:

    Comatose.configure do |config|
      # Sets the text in the Admin UI's title area
      config.admin_title = "Site Content"
      config.admin_sub_title = "Content for the rest of us..."
    end

### Feedback

Iâ€™ve released Comatose under the MIT license. Which basically means you 
can use it however you want.
